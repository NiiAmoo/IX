## Why visualize data?
 Good visualizations can give:
 
    * Powerful summaries of the underlying data 
    
    * Communicate insights often to audiences who do not have the same
        luxury of spending so much time with the data as you do. 
 
 As a Data analyst/ Scientist, it's your responsibility to give the necessary 
 **high level summaries or takeaways** in any data visual you create.

## Some Features of Good Visualizations
    
    * Clear on what it's communicating
    
    * Well defined axis, scaling and labels
    
    * Good choice of colors and anotations (visually appealing)
    
    * Less is more
    
    
## Some Features of Bad Visualizations
    
    * Cluttered,too much going on in the chart with no clear communication goal
    
    * Truncating axes to start at non-zero values which distorts interpretation
    
    * Poor choice of colors
    
    * Unnecessary 3D-fying 


## An Example of a Bad Visualization
#### What's wrong with this plot?

```{r}
pie
```


## What's wrong with that plot? 

 The visualization is bad because:
 
    * It's vague, putting together all movie ratings does help the
        audience identify what you're trying to communicate.
        
    * The rating categories are too many. Remember, good visuals give high 
        level summaries (less is more)
        
    * The pie chart used here is not the best tool for comparing multiple 
        categories. 
        
    * Pie charts also make it difficult for your audience to judge the relative 
        sizes of the slices.
        
    Let's make this visualization better.
        
## An Example of a Good Visualization
